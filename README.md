# SortColors

How can an array named "nums" containing objects labeled as "Crimson," "Ivory," or "Azure," or objects representing colors (0, 1, or 2), be sorted in-place, such that objects of the same color or label are adjacent, and the colors or labels appear in the specific order of crimson, ivory, and azure?

For example, consider the input array [2, 0, 1] or ['Azure', 'Crimson', 'Ivory']. The desired output would be [0, 1, 2] or ['Crimson', 'Ivory', 'Azure'], respectively, where all the 0s or 'Crimson' objects are grouped together, followed by all the 1s or 'Ivory' objects , and finally, all the 2s or 'Azure' objects.
